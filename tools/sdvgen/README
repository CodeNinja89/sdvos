sdvgen is the system generator for SDVOS kernel. To compile and install, simply
do the following:

  $> cd sdvgen
  $> ./autogen.sh
  $> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  $> make
  $> make install

After installation, checkout the manual page with:

  $> man sdvgen

Descriptions of options and examples are available in the manual page.

If you do not want to use the configuration script, there is also an existing
Makefile that you can use to compile sdvgen manually. This makefile is called
Makefile.manual in the src directory. To compile manually, do the following:

  $> cd sdvgen/src
  $> make -f Makefile.manual

Before doing this, please make sure you have lex and yacc (or flex and bison)
installed on your system.
