SDVOS is an OSEK and AUTOSAR compliant operating system designed to offer high
configurability and efficiency for embedded automotive applications. SDVOS
conforms to OSEK BCC1/2 and ECC1/2. Additionally, it supports AUTOSAR schedule
tables and software counters. Other AUTOSAR features and driver supports are
under active development.

Currently, the supported architectures include AVR5, ARM Cortex M3, and M4 with
FPU support. Reference boards currently supported include NUCLEO boards,
Arduino UNO, STM32 Discovery, etc. Additionally, an SDVOS instance can be
executed in the Linux environment for testing and debugging.
